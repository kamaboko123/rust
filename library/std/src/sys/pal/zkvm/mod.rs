//! System bindings for the risc0 zkvm platform
//!
//! This module contains the facade (aka platform-specific) implementations of
//! OS level functionality for zkvm.
//!
//! This is all super highly experimental and not actually intended for
//! wide/production use yet, it's still all in the experimental category. This
//! will likely change over time.
